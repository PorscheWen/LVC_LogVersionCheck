From the pressure distribution one can: -Check the pressure transmission situation -Check runner system pressure drop -Check flow balance of the design -Avoid overpacking and flashing of melt -Examine the extent of packing/holding.
Packing - Temperature = Plastic melt temperature distribution at current instant. For 3D calculation, the temperature distribution expresses temperatures in all three dimensional for the fully cavity.
