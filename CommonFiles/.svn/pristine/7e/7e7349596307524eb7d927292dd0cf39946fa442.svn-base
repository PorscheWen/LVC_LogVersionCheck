From the pressure distribution one can:   -Check the pressure transmission situation   -Check runner system pressure drop   -Check flow balance of the design   -Avoid overpacking and flashing of melt   -Examine the extent of packing/holding.
Temperature

Shear Stress
Shear stress at current instant is shown in different color according to different stress level. Shear stress is one of source of the molded-in residual stress in molded parts. If the shear stress is not distributed evenly, it will cause some dimensional problems. Too high the shear stress level will result in stress-induced problems in the molded part.
Shear Rate
The distribution of shear rate of part cavity is shown in different colors at current instant. Shear rate is the rate of shear deformation of the material during the polymer processing. Shear rate distribution is related to the variation of velocity gradient and molecular orientation. High shear rate tends to drastically deform molecular chains even to break and then weaken the strength of product. Viscous heating due to high shear rate also should be noticed.

Positive value represents volume shrinkage while negative value represents volume expansion due to over-pack. Non-uniform volumetric shrinkage will lead to warpage and distortion of demolded parts.

Furthermore, the residual stress and flow-induced orientation will be affected.

Center Temperature
Center temperature is the melt temperature of the middle layer (part line) in the thickness direction at current instant. Center temperature is an indicator of thermal energy supply of the fresh hot melt. In general, the center temperature is an indicator of incomplete filling (short shot). If the center temperature is too low, flow hesitation happens and there will be a short shot problem.
Average Temperature
Average temperature is the averaged temperature across the part thickness at current instant. It considers the effect of mold cooling and viscous heating of melt. Therefore, average temperature is representative for the part temperature. This data can be used to check the combined effect of viscous heating of polymer melt and mold cooling. One should examine if there is any hot spot that will cause burning problem and the possibility of short shot due to flow hesitation and excess mold cooling.
Bulk Temperature
Bulk temperature is a velocity-weighted averaged temperature of plastic melt across the thickness at current instant. The contribution from frozen layer that is stationary is ignored in this data. The effect of heat convection and viscous heating can be displayed from this data. Therefore, it can apparently demonstrate how heat convection affects the melt temperature and the temperature distribution of hesitation area and viscous heating area. Normally, bulk temperature distribution can reflect the trends or paths of filling flow.
Sink Mark Indicator
Sink Mark Indicator is also an index to evaluate the packing effect.   If the indicator is positive, it means the packing is not enough, which also may lead to sink mark.   If the indicator is negative, it means over packing.   A well packing keeps the indicator close to zero.

Shear Rate
The distribution of shear rate of part cavity is shown in different colors at current instant. Shear rate is the rate of shear deformation of the material during the polymer processing. Shear rate distribution is related to the variation of velocity gradient and molecular orientation. High shear rate tends to drastically deform molecular chains even to break and then weaken the strength of product. Viscous heating due to high shear rate also should be noticed.

Density
This shows the density distribution at current instant. In general, frozen region will show a greater value of density and molten region will have a lower density value. Non-uniformity in density is a source of part warpage.
Melt Front Temperature
Melt front temperature is the temperature value of the plastic melt    as it reaches the given point.   This value indicates how heat is conveyed and dissipated during the molding phases.
Viscosity (log)
Viscosity is an important property in fluids which   can be considered as the resistance of flow.   In polymers, both temperature and shear rate will   influence the value of viscosity. The viscosity is   constant at low shear rate, and then the viscosity   will decrease with increasing shear rate. Also, the   viscosity will decrease as temperature increases.
Reactive Heat Generation
Curing process is a kind of chemical exothermic   reaction. During this process, reactive heat generation   can be expressed by the cure kinetic model. Reactive heat   generation is dependent on the mold temperature and   the degree of cure.
Viscous Heat Generation
Viscous heat generation is the dissipation of mechanical energy in a viscous fluid. Generally,    the rate of viscous heat generation depends on the shear rate.    The higher Viscous heat generation comes with the higher    shear rate.

Residual stresses are stresses that remain after the original cause of the stresses (i.e. external forces, heat) has been removed.
Flow Induced Residual Stress Von Mises Stress
This is a scalar form of the components of the stress tensor; it also represents the overall magnitude of the residual stress tensor.
Flow Induced Residual Stress Maximum Shear Stress
The stress vector can be resolved into two components: one normal to the plane, called normal stress, and the other parallel to this plane, called the shear stress. If rotation is taken to specific axes, Maximum Shear Stress can be obtained. Yielding may begin when the maximum shear stress in a mechanical element reaches the experimental limitation of the material.
Flow Induced Residual Stress Relaxation Time
Relaxation time is defined as the time required for stress to be reduced to half of its original value. A higher relaxation time indicates more memory (elastic) effect. Frozen region will show a greater value of relaxation time and molten region will have a lower relaxation time value.
Flow Induced Residual Stress Maximum Principal Stress Total
The principal stresses and principal directions characterize the stress at a point, which are independent of different coordinate systems. The normal stresses turn to be the principal stresses while axes of coordinate parallel to the principal directions. Maximum Principal Stress, or called Maximum Normal Stress, is the largest value of the three principal stresses in injection molding. This value and direction can also qualitatively describe molecular orientation.

The effect of heat convection and viscous heating can be displayed from this data. Therefore, it can apparently demonstrate how heat convection affects the melt temperature and the temperature distribution of hesitation area and viscous heating area. Normally, bulk temperature distribution can reflect the trends or paths of filling flow.
